# ProtonTransfer

This program find the Hydrogen that moves the most in an .xyz file and assumes that it is the proton.

It then graphs the distance of Hydrogen, The Proton, and all Oxygen in respect to the 1st Oxygen. 

A new .xyz file is then created where each step has a 'p+' added at the bottom as a proton indicator.
